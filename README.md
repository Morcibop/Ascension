Basic tab with some information regarding the costs of leveling up a character, both in terms of Experience Books and Mora. More will be implemented in the future.

# F.A.Q

**Q: Can you get banned for using this app?**

A: No, Ascension is a standalone application that doesn't interact with Genshin Impacts' files in any way.

**Q: What does the app offer?**
A:
 * A simple visualization of Characters material needed for different Ascension Phases
 * A simple visualization of Weapon materials needed (Coming soon)
 * A roll counter, for each banner
 * Information about leveling cost, in terms of Exp Books and Mora (Resin calculator to be implemented)
 * Taroumaru to assist you during your rolls and keep track of them!

**Q: How can I keep the application over my game for easier use?**

A: Pressing F5 makes the application be Always On Top. In order for this to work, the game needs to be run in Borderless Window. [Here](http://github.com) you can find two ways to make the game Borderless.
