## Tab: Ascension

Users can select any available character in the game and see what type of materials they need to level up their characters and their talents. At the lower left, players can manage which Ascension Phase they want to track, and the values will update.

## Tab: Weapons

Under Development

## Tab: Info

Basic tab with some information regarding the costs of leveling up a character, both in terms of Experience Books and Mora. More will be implemented in the future.

## Tab: Rolls

Players can keep track of their rolls from the different banners available in the game, and use the different buttons to reset either the 4☆ Pity or the 5☆ Pity, they can reset the counter all together and set them up manually.

# F.A.Q

**Q: Can you get banned for using this app?**

A: No, Ascension is a standalone application that doesn't interact with Genshin Impacts' files in any way.

**Q: What does the app offer?**
A:
 * A simple visualization of Characters material needed for different Ascension Phases
 * A simple visualization of Weapon materials needed (Coming soon)
 * A roll counter, for each banner
 * Information about leveling cost, in terms of Exp Books and Mora (Resin calculator to be implemented)
 * Taroumaru to assist you during your rolls and keep track of them!

**Q: What is the Character Planner?**

A: You are presented with all the Characters cards. Selecting one sends you to a new section, where you can see the materials needed for that character, how much quantity and when you would be able to farm the books for talents. There is a special feature at the lower left side, which allows you to manage the phase cap (for those who love to stay at lvl 60!)

**Q: What is the Weapon Planner?**

A: Not finished yet, but will be implemented soon.

**Q: What is the Roll tab for?**

A: For those people that love to keep a better track of how their rolls are going, either be just the 4*, the 5*, or the total amount of rolls in their lifetime.

**Q: How can I keep the application over my game for easier use?**

A: Pressing F5 makes the application be Always On Top. In order for this to work, the game needs to be run in Borderless Window. [Here](http://github.com) you can find two ways to make the game Borderless.

**Q: How do I contribute?**

A: If you encounter with an issue, you can always send a bug report or suggestions [here](https://github.com/Morcibop/Ascension/issues)
